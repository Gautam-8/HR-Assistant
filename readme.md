# ðŸ¤– HR Assistant â€” LangChain RAG with LM Studio

This is an AI-powered HR Knowledge Assistant that allows employees to ask HR-related questions like:

- "How many vacation days do I get?"
- "Can I work remotely during probation?"
- "What benefits do we get for health insurance?"

The app uses **LangChain**, **Chroma**, and a **local LLM (via LM Studio)** to retrieve answers from uploaded HR documents.
